  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>The thing that I am working on in my personal life is football. I like to fish occasionally. These experiences have led me to playing with varsity and working with them and bettering myself with them and starting on varsity soon.
These can help me with my goal to working with them so I can better myself with them and doing that will make mw better and more hardworking.
The things that can help me with this is staying good in school and working as hard as I can with them.
One short term goal can I do is getting all aâ€™s and working more on football.
Some of the things I could be is playing football and being funny</p>
